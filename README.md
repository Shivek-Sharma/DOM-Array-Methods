# DOM Array Methods
I made this project while learning high order array methods and DOM manipulation.

# Project Specifications
• Fetch random users from the (https://randomuser.me/) API                                               
• Use forEach() method to loop and display users and their wealth                                        
• Use map() method to double wealth of each user                                                         
• Use filter() method to filter out only millionaires                                                    
• Use sort() method to sort users by wealth
